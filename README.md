### Continued development

Upon doing this project, it took me a bit if time trying to figure out styling and how to make the page more responsive. I realized that I still need to practice more on CSS and probably learn more about CSS frameworks which I hope can make styling more easier. I also realized that my workflow should focus on mobile first.
